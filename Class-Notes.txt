What is Project?
----------------
Collection of Software programs is called as Software Project.

Why to develop Software Projects?
----------------------------------
Software Projects are used to reduce human efforts.

Ex: Ticket Booking, Money transferring, Online shopping, food delivery.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Types of Companies
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Product based 

2) Service based

3) Consulting based

4) Audit firms


Product Based Companies
------------------------
1) These companies will develops products with their own ideas and they will sell in market.

2) Product based companies will not have clients they will have customers.


Ex : Dell, Samsung, Hp, Oracle, MS etc....

In Product based companies interview will be on 
core concepts like DataStructures, Algos and Design Patterns.


Service Based Companies
-----------------------
2) These companies will develop projects based on clients requirements.

Ex: TCS, Infosys, Wipro, TechM, Accenture, CG, CTS etc.....

In Service Based companies interviews will be on latest technologies in market.

Spring Boot, MicroServices, Angular etc....


Consulting Based Companies
--------------------------
Permanent Job
Contract Job


Ex : YOu are emp of Magna InfotTech and you are working for IBM.


Audit Firms

Business mens accounts management

Company Accounts management

Company Audits etc...


Big4 : Deloitte, PWC, E & Y and KPMG.
---------------------------------------------------------------------




Types of Projects
-----------------

1) Scratch Development Projects (5%-10%)

    - > Brand New Projects are called as scratch development

2) Maintenence/Support Projects (85 %)

		 - Enchancements
		 - Change Request
		 - M & O (Bug Fixing)

3) Migration Projects (10%)
	
		java version migration
		server version migration
		mainframes to java migration

Project Teams:
---------------
1) Onshore Team : Team which is working from client location
	
	a) Functional Team (Business Team)
	b) Dev Team
	c) Testing Team
	d) Admin team

2) Offshore Team : Team which is not working in client location.
	
	b) Dev Team
	c) Testing
	d) Admin

Note : Onshore and Offshore teams will communicate through Brdige Calls (VOIP) or Skype Business or WebEx or VC.




Project Development Procedure
-----------------------------

1) Company will make an agreement with Client For Project Development.

2) OnShore Functional Team will collect requirements from Client.

3) Onshore Functional team will prepare BRD (business requirement document) - High Level requriement document.

4) Onshore team will submit BRD to client for approval.

5) Client will provide approval for BRD.

6) Onshore functional team will prepare FDD/SRS using BRD.

	BRD - Business Requirement Document
	FDD - Functional Design Document
	SRS - Software requirement Specification

7) Onshore functional team will submit FDD to client for approval.

8) Client will provide FDD approval.

9) Onshore Functional team will setup bridge calls with Offshore team to explain FDD.

10) Onshore team will upload BRD and FDD in sharepoint location and they will Sharepoint URL to offshore team members.

11) Using Sharepoint URL offshore team members will download BRD and FDD.

12) Offshore team members will study FDD.

13) Offshore team members will write queries in Query Log.

14) OnShore team member will provide clarifications to queries.

15) Daily Meetings will be available to get clarifications on query log.

16) After meeting, we should send MoM (Minutes of Meeting).

17) After all queries got clarified, Developer will prepare TDD

	TDD - Technical Design document.

 Note: MicroSoft Vision, Star UML, Enterprise Architect (EA)

18) Developer should send TDD to project architect & functional team for approval.

19) Architect and Functional spoc will provide approval for developer TDD.

20) Post TDD approval , developer will start coding.

21) Developer will perform Unit Testing. (Junit & Mockito)

22) Code Review (PMD or SonarQube)

23) Push Code to Repository Server (SVN or GitHub or BitBucket)

24) Developer will perform Integration Testing (DIT)

25) Developer should capture DIT Results (Dev Artifacts)

26) SIT (system integration testing - software testers)

27) UAT (User acceptance Testing - client side ppl)

28) Pilot (similar to production/pre-production)

29) Production - Live

30) Maintenence & Operations (M & O).
